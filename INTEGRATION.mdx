## Overview

This template provides a productionâ€‘ready Aerospike instance as a Monk runnable. You can:

- Run it directly to get a managed Aerospike container with sensible defaults
- Inherit it in your own runnable to seamlessly add a high-performance NoSQL database to your stack

It exposes Aerospike on port 3000, persists data to a host volume, and is optimized for use cases that require low latency and high throughput such as real-time bidding, fraud detection, and recommendation engines.

## What this template manages

- Aerospike container (`aerospike` image, configurable tag)
- Network service on port 3000
- Persistent volume for data storage
- Hybrid memory architecture combining DRAM and flash memory for optimal performance

## Quick start (run directly)

1) Load templates

```bash
monk load MANIFEST
```

2) Run Aerospike with defaults

```bash
monk run aerospike/aerospike
```

3) Customize configuration (recommended via inheritance)

Running directly uses the defaults defined in this template's `variables`. To customize, you can either:

- Preferred: inherit and override variables as shown below.
- Alternative: fork/clone and edit the `variables` in `aerospike.yml`, then `monk load MANIFEST` and run.

Once started, connect to `localhost:3000` (or the runnable hostname inside Monk networks) to access the Aerospike service.

## Configuration

Key variables you can customize in this template:

```yaml
variables:
  image_tag: "ce-6.2.0.7_1"    # container image tag
  service_port: 3000            # service port (env: SERVICE_PORT)
```

Data is persisted under `${monk-volume-path}/aerospike:/opt/aerospike/data` on the host.

## Use by inheritance (recommended for apps)

Inherit the Aerospike runnable in your application and declare a connection. Example:

```yaml
namespace: myapp
db:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: aerospike/aerospike
api:
  defines: runnable
  containers:
    api:
      image: myorg/api
  connections:
    database:
      runnable: db
      service: base-svc
  variables:
    database-host:
      value: <- connection-hostname("database")
    database-port:
      value: "3000"
```

Then run your app:

```bash
monk run myapp/api
```

## Ports and connectivity

- Service: `base-svc` on TCP port `3000`
- From other runnables in the same process group, use `connection-hostname("<connection-name>")` to resolve the DB host.

## Persistence

- Data path: `${monk-volume-path}/aerospike:/opt/aerospike/data`
- All data is automatically persisted to the host volume, ensuring data durability across container restarts.

## Key features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput operations
- **Distributed Architecture**: Built-in support for data replication and automatic data distribution
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover in case of node failure
- **Hybrid Memory**: Combines DRAM and flash memory to maximize performance and minimize cost
- **Key-Value Model**: Supports key-value pairs with complex data types (lists, maps, sets)

## Use cases

Aerospike is particularly well-suited for:

- Real-time bidding platforms
- Fraud detection systems
- Recommendation engines
- E-commerce applications
- Ad tech solutions
- Financial services
- Any application requiring fast data access with high throughput

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the host volumes are writable by the container user.
- Check logs:

```bash
monk logs -l 500 -f aerospike/aerospike
```

- Verify the service is listening on the expected port:

```bash
monk describe aerospike/aerospike
```
